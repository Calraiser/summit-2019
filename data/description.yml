      text01: 'The <strong class="blue-color">LUCA ATP</strong>  service allows service providers to determine the timestamp of the last MSISDN/IMSI pairing change on the network and the unconditional call divert status of a MSISDN in real-time.'
      text02: 'A change of MSISDN/IMSI pairing in the network is commonly known as a SIM Swap and allows subscribers to move their mobile number (MSISDN) legitimately from one SIM card to another, for example in the case of loss or damage to their existing SIM card or an upgrade to a new device with a different SIM card form factor. After a SIM Swap is actioned on the network the customer MSISDN will be associated to the new IMSI of the new SIM card.'
      text03: 'A feature of the mobile network is to allow subscribers to permanently or temporarily divert their mobile phone number (MSISDN) to another phone number. This will be transparent to callers to the subscriber’s MSISDN. In the case of unconditional call diverts (the only type supported by this service), all calls to the subscriber MSISDN will be diverted to the provisioned number. Other types of call divert (e.g. conditional) can be setup on the network for the subscriber MSISDN (e.g. when phone out of coverage) but these are not supported by this service.'
